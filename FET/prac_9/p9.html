               The Document Object Model is a cross-platform and language-independent interface that treats an XML or HTML document as a tree structure wherein each node is an object representing a part of the document. The DOM represents a document with a logical tree.

The application of DHTML was introduced by Microsoft with the release of Internet Explorer 4 in 1997.
